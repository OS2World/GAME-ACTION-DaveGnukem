

Game features:
--------------

-	Implement "bonus" as a specific thing, not just a plain score increment
-	(Some?) monsters should only start updating the first time they appear in (or near?) the view
-	Implement more features (e.g. grappling hooks)
-	Switches, buttons
-	Access card
-	Add "creator name" to level file format and level editor
-	Dust effect: fix landing while jumping problem (sometimes will be no dust, if land on level one higher than from which one jumped)
-	Dust effect: clean up four-puff support, leave one-puff support
-	Dust effect: dust if jumping and head hits ceiling
-	HeroSetJumpMode(), I think this will screw up if hero is in midair if picks up boots (jump offset index)
-	Implement recording/playback of games (e.g. for demo)
-	Add hero skeleton-when-hurt thingy
-	Bouncing spiked balls should absorb bullets
-	Timing on flame-shoot thingies is a little severe

Monsters:
---------

-	Bunny thing
-	Flat thing on wheels
-	Spinning wheel thing with alternating on/off flames that can only be killed when flames are off
-D	Fire (similar to dumb robot)
-	Big shooting things
-	Small floating shooting robot things
-	Helicopter
-	Big spinning figure-8 snake-like thingy

Sound:
------

-	SOUND: Get/produce more sounds
-	SOUND: Replace existing sounds (current sounds are mostly extremely cheesy)
-	SOUND: Sounds should mix (currently if a new sound starts the previous one stops)
-	SOUND: When in KDE, all sounds seem to have a severe latency to play

Input:
------

-	INPUT: Add joystick support
-	INPUT: Get rid of DJKEY_ stuff altogether

Load/save game:
-	Implement loading and saving of games
-	Should save/load current mission
-D	If you load powerboots, you still can't jump high

Bullets:

-	Improve bullet graphics
-D	Need monster bullets
-D	Bullets sometimes miss robots
-D	Bullet should stop when it hits solid objects
-D	Bullet shouldn't "continuous-fire" the way they do
-D	Implement max firepower

Editor:

-	Improve the level editor
-	Sort out SDL mouse cursor crap
-	Sort out flickering in full-screen mode
-	Don't use alt+mouse-click for ed, KDE steals that rudely
-D	Ditch the palette stuff completely, calculate sprite display colours from sprite

Documentation:

-	Bring readme up to date
-	Improve and complete doxygen documentation

General stuff:

-	Create decent levels
-	Improve the graphics
-	Improve the levels
-	Timing problems on WinME (runs at max possible frame rate) (may be fixed with SDL?)
-D	Slower and jerky in Linux (port to SDL ..)
-D	Sticky-key problems in Linux (port to SDL ..)
-D	Port to SDL [Done, but still wrapper layers .. will leave these around till I get sick of them]
-D	Did I say "port to SDL" ..?

Graphics-related issues:

-	Blit to front buffer blurry on some systems
-	Hide mouse cursor in Win32

Medium priority:
-	Make high score list a little harder to edit (although the nature of OpenSource makes this tricky :)
 
Low priority:

Possible optimizations (not (yet) high priority):
-	Use hardware blits
-	Array of CThing's should be kept sorted by layer to optimize drawing loops
-	Fewer layers? I don't seem to be using them all anyway.
-D	CThing: Draw(): Bounds checking should be done by game, not Draw() function;
	Draw() should not even get called if out of bounds

Minor bugs, known issues etc:

-	Discovered you don't need to be root to use DGA, you just need
	access to /dev/mem. Fix up scripts, documentation etc to reflect this.

Other todo:
-	Make sprite interface more generic, handle multiple sizes etc

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE
----

-D	Implement sound (again :)
-D	Make keys redefinable
-D	If you die, items picked up during that level only should be removed from inventory. Same with firepower and score.
-D	"Dust" that gets kicked up as hero lands on ground
-D	Stationary spiked balls
-D	End-of-level exit should animate when activated
-D	Small pop-up spike action bounds should be smaller
-D	Conveyor belts should probably be "things" too
-D	If jumping up and hit monster (or anything that hurts??) should be knocked down
-D	(-1,-1,-1,-1) bounds are overlapping hero
-D	Implement high score list
-D	Box with flames when shot
-D	Dynamite flames should also have flames right in middle
-D	Fans that stop when shot
-D	Fans should stop slowly. Also they should spin when shot.
-D	Can of coke should fly up when shot
-D	Floating balloon: Should disappear when hit ceiling
-D	Side flame thrower blocks
-D	Remove all palette stuff
-D	Background image for level
-D	Acme falling block
-D	Floating balloon
-D	"Objects" should be "things" ("CCollectable"? No - CPickup)
-D	Lifts should just be "things" too
-D	Implement shooting of security cameras
-D	Implement bouncing spiky ball
-D	Scores of 0 generate floating score displays
-D	Doors/keys #0 don't work properly (rewrite messy door code) [Rewritten completely]
-D	Sometimes you can go through doors (??) [Should be fixed, thanks to complete rewrite of door code]
-D	Implement turkey (+ shoot) [Did a banana instead]
-D	CThing: Need a virtual initialization function so that we can generically initialize from list of "extras".
-D	Implement bonus for collecting G,N,U,K,E,M letters in order
-D	Implement bonus for shooting all cameras in a level
-D	Spikes (both big static ones and small pop-up ones)
-D	Acme falling block: Should disappear when collide with floor (should explode though)
-D	Remove all own djArray array stuff, convert to STL vector
-D	Scrap "lives"
-D	WhyTF do stationary spiked balls show purple on edges? (sprite transparency seems OK)
-D	Dynamite should fall (done but not tested)
